Twitter sentiment and crypto prices prediction

Cryptocurrencies are an exponentially growing financial market and highly volatile in price. Its volatile nature makes it very difficult to do predictions by using traditional methods. Twitter is one of the most used social media platforms by crypto investors and users. In this report, we have presented a method to use Twitter to predict cryptocurrency prices using tweets sentiment analysis and historical prices data. 
We scraped and labeled tweets, preprocessed them, trained an LSTM classifier for sentiment analysis, performed statistical tests and used sentiment score along with volume of tweets to successfully predict direction and magnitude of Ethereum and Near Protocol prices. 
These predictions can be very beneficial for crypto traders and investors as they can analyze the public opinion and make better profitable decisions.
